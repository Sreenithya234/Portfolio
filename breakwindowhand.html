<p>You chose to break the window with your hand. You punch the window but...it didnt break. Instead it made a VERY loud noise and now your fist hurts. The guards hear the sound and find you. They ask you who you are and you get scared and tell them everything. They immediately take you back to your kingdom and warn you to never come back to their kingdom. You leave and go back to the castle. You tell your paremts everything and they are very angry at you. Your punishment (that I told you about at the beginning) is that you are kicked out of your kingdom. THE END:/ </p>
