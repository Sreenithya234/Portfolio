<p> You got off your carriage and walked behind it. You plan kinda failed since walking behind didn't do anything. You're literally wearing armor so they knew it was your carriage. You got some weird looks from all of them and after you passed by them...the horses ran away and took the carriage with it. You now don't have a ride and have to walk. </p>
    




<p> You should maybe try to blend in more with everyone else. Should you stop my one of the villages and try to fit in by getting more neutral clothes? <a href= "neutral.html">GET NEUTRAL CLOTHES</a>or <a href= "sticktoarmor.html">STICK TO YOUR ARMOR</a>.</p>
