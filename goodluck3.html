 <p>   You set off to your adventure and it is so far going well. You are looking for a blue jewel. Everything is going smoothly as you sneak past the guards and enter the kingdom. You were able to sneak past the guards easily but had to be careful to make sure you and your horse didn't make any sound. </p>
    
<p> You are going down to the kingdom and it's going well when...you see 3 villagers coming your way!!! You are wearing armor so they might suspect something! What will you do? <a href= "noeyecontact3.html">GO STRAIGHT WITHOUT MAKING EYE CONTACT</a> or <a href= "run.html"> RUN AWAY</a>
