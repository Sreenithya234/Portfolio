 <p> You chose to go back to the boring room. You ran back to the boring room hoping nobody saw you. You make it there and open the door. You lock it and rip everything apart looking for it. You also had to try to make the least amount of noise possible since you broke the window which means the guards will be able to hear you from outside. This room is actually very big which made it really hard to look for the jewel. The only thing you knew about the jewel was that it was blue. After 30 minutes of searching, you collapse on the floor. There was no way that you could find it, you thought.You start to think you should give up until something caught your eye. You began to notice the chandelier on the ceiling. It looked odd. It didn't look like a chandelier. It also looked like it was gonna fall any second. You quickly got up. What do you do? <a href= "lookchandelier.html">EXAMINE THE CHANDELIER</a>or <a href= "leaveit.html">LEAVE IT AND KEEP LOOKING THROUGH THE ROOM</a>.</p>
