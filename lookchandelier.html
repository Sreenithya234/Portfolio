  <p> You decide to take a closer look at the chandelier. You find a ladder (weird place to put a ladder but still) and when you climb up the ladder, you are shocked. First of all, the chandelier is literally about to fall and you can tell, second of all, there's an imprint on the chandelier, and third of all, the chandelier isn't even a chandelier. The "chandelier" was about to fall but you catch it on time. You get off the ladder and take a closer look. First of all, there's an imprint. The imprint is an imprint of a jewel of some sort and you realize that you've been seeing pictures of the jewel everywhere!! That's the jewel! That must be the jewel! But, the jewel isn't there. Somebody must've tooken it, but who? You then remember, the villager!! The villager/worker at your castle who was envious of you. He has always been begging your parents to promote him in someway. It must've been him! You rush out of the room by jumping out the window. You run to your kingdom when you see him! On your way there you see him! The villager!He was also running and you could see in his hand, the blue jewel!! You chase after him and finally catch up to him. <a href= "trip.html">TRIP HIM</a>or<a href= "kick.html">KICK HIM</a>??</p>
