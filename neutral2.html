<p>You chose to go and find neutral clothes. You decide to get off your carriage for a bit before carrying on. Just as you get off you carriage, there's a very loud sound. You don't know what it is but it startled you. It scared your horses more since the horse ran away from the the sound. There was no use to chase after them since it was quite fast. So um.. you just lost your carriage. You decide to  keep on walking. After walking for a while you see a sign. It says to go left or right. Left is 2 miles away from where you are right now and right is 5 miles away. Which way will you choose? <a href= "2miles.html">2 MILES AWAY</a> or the<a href= "5miles.html">5 MILES AWAY</a>?</p>
