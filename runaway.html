<p> You chose to run away! But...your plan fails since they already spotted you and now it'll look sketchy if you run away so you have to keep going straight. A lot more people started staring at you now since you almost ran away. You didn't make eye contact though. You keep walking when you come by what seems to be a village. You take a closer look and you see that they're selling clothes! It'll look better than your armor! Do you <a href= "buy.html">BUY THE CLOTHES</a> or do you <a href= "passby.html">GO THROUGH THE VILLAGE BUT STICK TO YOUR ARMOR</a>?</p>
