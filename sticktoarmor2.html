<p> You chose to stay in your armor. You keep walking when you see a sign. To get a better look at the sign, you get off your horse. As soon as you get off, the horse runs away!! There was no point of chasing it so you just left it.  It says to go left or right. The left side is 2 miles away and the right side is 5 miles away. Which way will you go? <a href= "2miles.html">LEFT (2 MILES)</a> or the <a href="5miles.html">RIGHT (5 MILES)</a>?</p>
