<p> You decided to go straigt ahead towards the 30 people in your armor! You went straight ahead and they actually ignored you! Although a couple of them stared at you while you were passing by. You keep walking and feels like you've been walking for an hour. You know if you had transportation right now that would really help you..but you don't._. You finally come across what semms to be a village. there are a lot of people out and...they're selling clothes. Normal clothes that won't make you stand out! Do you buy them? <a href= "buy.html">BUY CLOTHES</a>or do you<a href= "passby.html">GO THROUGH THE VILLAGE TRYING TO LOOK FOR THE CASTLE WHERE THE JEWEL IS AND NOT BUY THE CLOTHES</a>?</p>
