<p> You tell the truth to the guards. BIG MISTAKE! They take you back to your kingdom and leave you there. There's no point on trying to go back since they now know what you look like and warn everyone to keep a look out for you. You go back to your castle. Tell your parents what happen and they are really mad. Your punishment is that you are now kicked out of the castle and kicked out of your kingdom. START OVER? <a href= "index.html">START OVER FROM THE BEGINNING</a> or <a href= "runopposite.html">GO BACK AND CHOOSE TO RUN THE OPPOSITE WAY AWAY FROM THE GUARDS</a>. </p>
