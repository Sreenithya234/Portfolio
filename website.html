    <h7> Hi! My name is Sreenithya and I'm 11 years old! Today I had my first web developement class and I liked it. I had it from 9:00am to 11:00am. I basically learned how to make this blog and more. I didn't do anything else that interesting today.</h7><p>

        <h7> So I didn't write anything on Sunday since nothing really happened. Today i just did homework through online school. I have one more week 'till school ends so I'm relieved about that. I don't know what I'm going to do this summer but hopefully I'll get a dog simce my parents said we'll might get one. I don't know if i'll do anything else due to quarantining. I can't really talk to my friends in person or go anywhere. I didn't really do anything else today.</h7>

         <h7>Today I did homework. I don't really do anything ineresting since we're in quarantine.I also practiced piano today. I don't think I mentioned it but I play piano. I'm in level 6 and it goes up to level 10. I do online piano classes now but it used to be in real life. I've been doing since I was about six years old. I think it's kind of fun. I'll probably finish level 10 when I'm in grade 9 or 10. That's all I have to write for today. </h7>
