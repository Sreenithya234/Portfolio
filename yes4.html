   <p> Well... there really isn't a way for you to get into the room without the guards seeing you. Let's try anyways. You find a room with guards and you need to distract them somehow. You find a stack of plates nearby and decide to throw the plates at the guards. So you take the plates, hide behind a wall, and start throwing plates at them. At first didn't react but then, they started to run away. The commotion made the guards from the inside of the room open the door but you start throwing plates at them too. They also run away in a panic and you go into the room and lock the door. You start to look for the jewel everywhere. You checked everywhere but you didn;t find anything. You also didn't find anything valuable either. Meanwhile when you were about to leave, you hear someone banging on the door. YOUR DOOR. They had to be the guards. There was nothing for you to do. The room didn't have any windows and it's not like you have weapons to go against the guards. You begin to panic when the door breaks open!! The guards come in and you explain everything. They immediately take you and kick you out of the castle. You know there's no point of going back into the castle so the only thing you can do is go home. You arrive to your kingdom the next morning and explained to your parents why you don't have the jewel. They are furious and punish you. Your punishment: you got kicked out of the kingdom:( <a href= "index.html">START OVER?</a> or <a href= "explorethecastle.html">GO BACK AND PICK ANOTHER CHOICE?</a> </p>
